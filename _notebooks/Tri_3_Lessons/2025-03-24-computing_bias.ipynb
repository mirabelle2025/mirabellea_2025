    "Explicit Data is information that a user intentionally provides. This data is typically given directly through forms, surveys, or user settings.<br/>\n",

    "Implicit Data is information that is gathered without direct user input, often inferred from user behavior or actions. This data is typically collected passively as a user interacts with a system.<br/>\n",
    "Example: A music streaming service tracking which songs a user listens to most frequently and using that data to generate personalized recommendations. The user did not explicitly say, \"I like these songs,\" but their behavior suggests their preferences."
