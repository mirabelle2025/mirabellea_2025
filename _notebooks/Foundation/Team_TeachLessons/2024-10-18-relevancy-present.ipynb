    "| College Board Coverage  | 20            | 20       | College Board states: Iteration is a repetitive portion of an algorithm. Iteration repeats until a given condition is met or for a specified number of times. The use of recursion is a form of iteration. I taught the While and Do-while loops for my portion of the Iteration lesson that my group taught. Teaching the while and do-while loops fits this definition of iteration because both are examples of repetitive control structures that execute a block of code multiple times until a specific condition is met. Both while and do-while loops allow a section of code to run repeatedly, forming the core of iterative processes.  |\n",
