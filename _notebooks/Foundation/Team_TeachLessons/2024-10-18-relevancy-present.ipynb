    "- I started with zero knowledge on coding and how to navigates vscode, github, etc.\n",
    "- Quickly, I learned how to follow the steps on the CSP Setup page. If a step failed I knew which step to fall back on and redo the proccess until my website was up and running. It took a lot of mistakes to how to properly manage my website.\n",
    "- After I got my website up and running, I was able to edit every page with my own unique ideas and themes. We started off by editing our About Me page to add our background and personality. I learned how to change the color of my page (theme) on my own, how to format each image, how to add emojis, how to change titles, how to add a link to my Youtube Page. \n",
    "- Next, we worked on our home, Nighthawk page. I added a table with links to different html pages. In order to be more unique I added a page to my own coded calculator, a link to my google calendar, a link to my favorite spotify playlist, a link to my unique snake game that has edited formatting, and a button that changes the theme of my page.\n",
    "- Next, we had to create a lesson on the CB Big Idea 3. I was assigned to teach Lesson 3.8.2, Do-while and While loops. Throughout this lesson I learned how to project my voice, present clearly, add on with my knowledge on the spot. \n",
    "- Then after the presentation, we individually graded everyone's homework and hacks that were done for our lesson. \n",
    "- We also received grades for each of our hacks and homeworks and I received more than a 0.9 for each lesson. This proves that I went above and beyond for each lesson, turned them in on time, and followed their grading rubric very clearly. "

    "| College Board Coverage  | 20            | 20       | College Board states: Iteration is a repetitive portion of an algorithm. Iteration repeats until a given condition is met or for a specified number of times. The use of recursion is a form of iteration. I taught the While and Do-while loops for my portion of the Iteration lesson that my group taught. Teaching the while and do-while loops fits this definition of iteration because both are examples of repetitive control structures that execute a block of code multiple times until a specific condition is met. Both while and do-while loops allow a section of code to run repeatedly, forming the core of iterative processes.  |\n",
