    "    - Every NIC card has it's own MAC address that allows us to \"hop\" from one device to another.\n",

    "    - Packet jumps from router to router, changing their MAC addresses as they go.\n",

    "*Summary*: In order to safely transmit data, there are layers to the internet. Network access sets up devices with IP addressed needed for communication, Internet protocal packages and jumps from device to device, transport checks for bugs/debugging, and application is what we see."
