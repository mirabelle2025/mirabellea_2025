    "**Improve:** People recommended to add more features, as some of them may seem repetitive or not as intereseting. They also gave critisim on the overall presentation, and said that it would’ve been done more smoothly. This will defintley help for when we make the College Board video, and the next step would be to address these concerns.\n",
    "**Keep:** People liked the organization of our website, and thought some of our features were fun to play aroundn with. The color scheme was also complemented, people said it suits the theme of our website."

    "# Reflection\n",
    "**Strengths**: I think that I really improved with my overall tech sense and tech talk from last trimester. AT the end of last trimester I said that I wanted to improve on workign iwth the backend and implementing it with our frontend in our website, and I think that I greatly improved on that escpecially since I took on the role of being Backend Admin Engineer, where I customized our backend UI and created screens for admin functions. I ensured that db_backup, db_init, and db_restore are supported and working properly.\n",
    "**Weaknesses**: I think that a weakness of mine was during the introduction of the API's and non-static data being implemented into our website. Our group started to fall behind and I noticed that I wasn't able to just get by with doing the simple tasks in the tasks. Ir eally had to work with my group and Mr. Mort in order to learn from our mistakes and create a successful website.\n",
    "**Project Future Plans**: We really need to work on making our project presentable to submit for the college board Exam. We don't fully have our full stack Demo where I think we will be able to earn a 5. We took the N@TM feedback and will be adding more features that are interactable.\n",
    "**Future Plans in CS**: I plan on taking on a data analyst interniship this summer at a pharmaseutical company down in La Jolla. This class has taught me a lot fo life skills and fundemental coding knowledge that gave me this opportunity, which I am very thankful for. Since I am a senior and already submitted all of my college application, I know what I am going to major in college. This class helped me to decide that I want to do something with Computer Science and the STEM department. I look forward to continuing my carrer after this class."
