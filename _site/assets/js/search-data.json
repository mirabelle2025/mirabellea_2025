            "content": "Big Idea 4 College Board Notes . Video 1 . 4.1- The Internet . Packet: Small amounts of data that get carried to a source and destination, similar to a jigsaw puzzle. | Computer Network: Allows communication between two computers/users Uses paths and routing, routing is the pathfinder that allows for data communication. | . | Bandwith: The maximum amount of data that can be sent along ONE path. Summary: Computer devices are able to SEND information by breaking down data into packets, which are then routed into paths. Computer networks connect mulitple paths, allowing another user to RECEIVE the information sent. | . Video 2 . OSI: Open Systems Interconnect, 1 out of the 2 main communication protocols in computers created by IETF. | TCP: Transimission Control Protocol, 2 out of the 2 main communication protcols, establishes common standard for message sending. There are 4 layers to internet protocol: Network Access: Focuses on hardware (Ethernet–&gt; NIC–&gt;MAC) | Every NIC card has it’s own MAC address that allows us to “hop” from one device to another. Internet Protocol: Packets get sender IP and receiver IP, and are now ready to transfer metadata. | | Packet jumps from router to router, changing their MAC addresses as they go. Transport Layer: Uses either Transmision Control Protocol or User Datagram Protcol | | TCP: Checks for errors, then FIXES them. | UDP: Checks for errors, then DISCARDS them. Application Layer: DNS and the World Wide Web | | DNS: Translates human URLs into IP addresses, so they can be tracked | WWW: NOT the internet, HTTP (uses URLS to link to other data) Summary: In order to safely transmit data, there are layers to the internet. Network access sets up devices with IP addressed needed for communication, Internet protocal packages and jumps from device to device, transport checks for bugs/debugging, and application is what we see. | . | . Video 3 . Redundancy: Having multiple paths in a computer network allows for Fault Tolerance (a working communication system even when one path shuts down.) Summary: The internet is fault tolerant. This is crucial because it would be bad if the entire internet breaks down due to a single path. Redundancy, or having multiple paths for communication prevents this from happening. | . Video 4 . Fault Tolerance: There are multiple paths data can take to get from one device to any other device on the network. When more devices are added the network becomes stronger. | . Video 5 . Computer Tasks: Tasks need to be scheduled by the operating system. Balance tasks so all CPUs are beign used evenly and fully. Sequentially, in parallel, and distibuted to other computers. | Sequential Tasks done one after another. Adds up all the individual task execution times. | Parallel Computing schedules tasks to be executed at the same time. Done on the same computer. SOlutions scale more effictively. | Sppedup Time measured in the time it took to complete the task sequentially divided by the time it took to complete the task when done in parallel. | Distributed Computing sending of tasks from on ecomputer to one or more. Multiple devices are used to run a program. Needs a network. Mixes sequential and parallel. | .",

The fetch() function sends an HTTP request to the backend. The request method is POST, meaning data is sent to the server.

After Fetching (Output from API) The API returns an array of objects, each representing a channel: . | Show how changing data or method triggers a different response, specifically normal conditions and error conditions. | . Purpose of Individual Feature . This is what the flowchart begun: | This is a screenshot of the current flowchart of the tables I have been working on | In this screenshot you can see that I organized all of the countries to be connected to the groups.py | I noticed that all of our postings on our review pages would only show up in our channel table in the backend, so I followed the flowchart to see which tables it was connected to | I found that the Channel table was also the only table connected to the posts.py, so I follwed those tables to find code that would connect the countries to the posts.py | I successfully connected the nigerias table to the posts table, which I think is a step forward to my end goal | . Areas to work on / Burn down list . Connect the rest of the countries to the posts table (Use same code as nigerias) | Allow the backend to connect to the frontend | Once the backend is connected to the frontend, have the frontend show the review on our website | Get rid of failed to fetch error | Here is a screenshot of my latest burndown list: | . Purpose of Groups Program . Input/Output: . Posting feature for API Request and response | to show the RESTful API, we can plug in a URL into Postman (ex: http://127.0.0.1:8887/api/food), which then displays all the information under the “food” class of our code under our maps. | We created various table in SQLite using the CRUD method. The following commands allow us to creat, save, and remake the tables. (db_init, db_restore, db_backup). First we run db_init to make, db_backup to save the table, and db_restore to re make. List Requests: | About me Page: Each of the names and role assignments are our basic JSON data, which we then convert into API by attatching it to the API URL. By then attatching this URL to the frontend, it shows up as a part of our UI. | Working with columns was done by using the CRUD method, as well as making different classses. For example, in our About Me Page, every memeber in our group has their own defined class. When displayed in the frontent, these classes will show up as their own induvidual columns. Algorithmic Code Requests: | Staying on our About Me Page, we have a seperate code in our Frontend that specifies the method of GET, PULL, POST, or etc. Because of the specifies path, the URL then gets fetched and displayed on our website. Therefore, we have created our body of request in the backend which them shows up as a jasonify-ed version of our data in the frontend | This process of code is also know as Iteration, because of how we looped the information of everyone in this group. Call to Algorithm Request: | . | Call and Requesting through Postman can be done by adding a breakpoint. The error that Postman gives us after adding the breakpoint, and then the debugging process shows how we handle data. | Changing the data within our backend files immediatley affects other things. For example, in our code that creates SQLite tables, we can easily edit our tester data. When we remake the table, it will display with new information, ass a result of the changed data. | . Group’s Plan . As a group we worked together to get our posting in our review page for our countries to work from backend to frontend. | A function that we added was changing the group name for asia to japan when posting a review, which organizes our posts into categories | This image shows how when we type in our review (Restarunt Name, Stars, and Description) it runs through our backed and is shown on our website through our frontend | This image shows our table in our bakend that stores the data of our review | .",

            "content": "Introduction . Welcome to this journey into the world of web servers and the Flask framework! In the previous weeks, you’ve successfully set up a web server using GitHub Pages, converting Jupyter Notebooks into Markdown for a seamless online presentation. Today, we’ll take that knowledge to the next level as we dive into creating your very own web server using Flask. . Understanding Web Servers . What is a Web Server? . Traditionally, we had librarians at libraries that would help you find books or information. Today in the digital world, thousands upon thousands of home pages, search engines, and digital archives have been built using web servers. . GitHub Pages vs. Flask . You’ve already experienced a form of web server through GitHub Pages. Think of GitHub Pages as a library that has established rules for publishing Markdown notes and Jupyter Notebooks neatly on a bookshelf. . Now, let’s introduce Flask, your personal web server. Flask can create and manage any type of content, including customizing everything according to your preferences, and even serve additional information (like a database with APIs). . The Flask Framework Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It’s designed to be minimal and easy to use, making it perfect for building web applications, APIs, and, yes, even your web server. Today, we will start with the basics of Flask and see how it empowers you to create and manage web content. . Our Goals for Today . Here’s what we’ll accomplish in this session: . Create a minimal Flask server. | Explore the Python/Flask process. | Access data from our Flask server using Python. | Access data from our Flask server using JavaScript. | Learn how to stop the Python/Flask process gracefully. | .

Answer C is correct. The code segment “ticket price &lt;- 12 ; IF age ≤ 12 OR age ≥ 60 ; ticketPrice &lt;- 9 ; IF is 3D ; ticketPrice &lt;- ticketPrice + 5” initially sets ticketPrice to 12, and then changes the price to 9 only for children and seniors. The code segment then increases ticketPrice by 5 for 3-D movies. . Q14 Comparing loop algorithms Answer: C ; Incorrect Answer: B Answer B is incorrect because the programs will display different values. Answer C is correct becuase the programs each display ten values, but each value displayed by program B is one greater than the corresponding value from the program A. Program A displays 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and program B displays 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11. . Q21 Comparing robot algorithms Answer: B ; Incorrect Answer: A Answer A is incorrect because “MoveXTimes 2 ; RightXTimes 1 ; MoveXTimes 3” moves the robot forawrd two squares, rotates it right one time so that the robot faces the bottom of the grid, and then moves the robot forward three squares. Answer B is correct because “MoveXTimes 2 ; RightXTimes 3 ; MoveXTimes 3” moves the robot forward two squares, rotates it right three times so that the robot faces the top of the grid, and then moves the robot forward three squares to the gray square. . Q25 Shortening strings by replacing TH and IS Answer: B ; Incorrect Answer: D Answer D is incorrect because “NEITHER_HERE_NOR_THERE” can be shortened using byte pair encoding. For example, “NEIT* ER_* &amp;_NOR_T* &amp;” by replacing each instance of “HE” with “* “ and each instance of “RE” with “&amp;” Answer B is correct because it is not possible to use byte pair encoding in the string “LEVEL_UP” because no pair of characters appears in the string more than once. .",

Iteration repeats until a given condition is met or for a specified number of times. The use of recursion is a form of iteration. I taught the While and Do-while loops for my portion of the Iteration lesson that my group taught. Teaching the while and do-while loops fits this definition of iteration because both are examples of repetitive control structures that execute a block of code multiple times until a specific condition is met.

MetaData: In this article the MetaData contains information about the sprite, including its name, source URL, and orientation details such as the number of rows and columns, header size, padding, and jagged rows. . Class: In this context the canvas and drawing operations are intialized and stored in a class. These are used to output sprite sheet image and individual frames within the sprite sheet. . constructor: Initializes the canvas, context, and sprite image. | draw() method: Uses nested **for-loops to iterate through the sprite sheet and draw each frame independently on the canvas.

Alter the Hidden Data to your own message. . %%js // Extrat the hidden data from the page var dataElement = document.getElementById(&#39;data&#39;); if (dataElement) { // Display the data in the console console.log(dataElement.innerText); } else { console.error(&#39;Element with id &quot;data&quot; not found.&#39;); } . &lt;IPython.core.display.Javascript object&gt; . Other outputs explored . There are several ways to ouput the classic introduction message: “Hello, World!” . These “other outputs” are for developers. . Before you go further, open Console on your Browser. JavaScript developer leaves Console open all the time!!! | The function console.log() outputs to Console, this is often used for inspection or debugging. | “Hello, World” is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. Developer call this a hard coded string. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; literal is a parameter to console.log(), element.txt() and alert(). | The element.textContent is part of Jupyter Notebook %%js magic. This is convenient for Notebook and testing. | The alert command outputs the parameter to a dialog box, so you can see it in this Jupyter notebook. The alert commands are shown, but are commented out as the stop run all execution of the notebook. | Note, in a Web Application Debugging: An alert is often used for less savy Developers. Console is used by more savy developers; console often requires setting up a lot of outputs. Source level debugging is the most powerful solution for debugging and does not require alert or console commands. | . %%js // required to allow cell to be JavaScript enabled console.log(&quot;JavaScript/Jupyter Output Intro&quot;); // Browser Console output; debugging or tracing console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); // HTML page output using DOM (Document Object Model) from previous cell document.getElementById(&quot;output&quot;).textContent = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; // Jupyter Only, output for development element.append(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); // element is an output option as part of %%js magic // alert(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); . &lt;IPython.core.display.Javascript object&gt; . multiple outputs using a variable . This second example is a new sequence of code, two or more lines of code forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, thank goodness!!! In the previous example we were typing the string &quot;Hello, World&quot; over and over. Observe with the variable msg=&quot;Hello, World!&quot;; we type the string once and now use msg over and over. . The variable “var msg =” is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console, be sure to Inspect it! | The element.text() is part of Jupyter Notebooks and displays as output blow the code on this page. Until we build up some more interesting data for Web Site, we will not use be using the Python HTML, CSS technique. | The alert(msg) works the same as previous, but as the other commands uses msg as parameter. | . %%js console.log(&quot;Variable Definition&quot;); var msg = &quot;Hello, World Again!&quot;; // Use msg to output code to Console and Jupyter Notebook console.log(msg); //right click browser select Inspect, then select Console to view document.getElementById(&quot;output&quot;).textContent = msg; element.append(msg); //alert(msg); . &lt;IPython.core.display.Javascript object&gt; . output showing use of a function . This example passes the defined variable “msg” to the newly defined “function logIt(output)”. . There are multiple steps in this code.. The definition of the function: “function logIt(output) {}” and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. Passing a parameter is required when you call this function. | The “call to the function:”logIt(msg)” is the call to the function, this actually runs the function. The variable “msg” is used a parameter when calling the logIt function. | . | Showing reuse of function… There are two calls to the logIt function | This is called Prodedural Abstraction, a term that means reusing the same code | . | . %%js console.log(&quot;Function Definition&quot;); /* Function: logIt * Parameter: msg * Description: The parameter is &quot;msg&quot; is output to console, jupyter and &quot;output&quot; element in HTML */ function logIt(msg) { console.log(msg); element.append(msg); document.getElementById(&quot;output&quot;).textContent = msg; //alert(output); } // sequence of code build logIt parameter using concatenation var msg = &quot;Hello, Students!&quot; // replaces content of variable var classOf = &quot;Welcome CS class of 2024-2025.&quot; logIt(msg + &quot; &quot; + classOf); // concatenation of strings . &lt;IPython.core.display.Javascript object&gt; . output showing Loosely typed data . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don’t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. . To define a variable you prefix the name with var or const. The variable type is determined by JavaScript at runtime. | Python and many interpretive languages are loosely typed like JavaScript. This is considered programmer friendly. | Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see terms like String, Integer, Double, and Object in the source code. | In JavaScript, the typeof keyword returns the type of the variable. Become familiar with type as it is valuable in conversation and knowing type help you understand how to modify data.

            "content": "GitHub Pages Coding Introduction . Building the entire frontend GitHub Pages web application requires knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. GitHub Pages has built-in support for an additional content language called Markdown, which is a shorthand complement to HTML. Markdown is focused on creating static content. . HTML is responsible for the content | Markdown is a shorthand way of writing content | CSS adds styling to the web page content | JavaScript adds functionality and interactivity | . In GitHub Pages, Jekyll serves as the build framework. It takes our choice of theme specified in the _config.yml file, along with our Markdown, HTML, and notebook files, to construct a complete static website. A significant portion of the frontend design work has already been done for users through the selection and use of a theme; this greatly reduces the need to code in CSS. . Jekyll converts Markdown (.md) files into HTML. Behind the scenes of GitHub Pages, Jekyll and the Liquid programming language build and programmatically construct each Markdown file into a specific web page. Markdown provides a straightforward way to start with GitHub Pages development. In a Markdown file, you can exclusively use Markdown syntax or incorporate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based on your expertise and experience. . What is Static Content? . Static content refers to web pages that are delivered to the user’s browser exactly as stored, without any server-side processing or dynamic content generation. This means the content remains the same for every user and does not change unless the source files are manually updated. Static websites are typically faster, more secure, and easier to deploy compared to dynamic websites, which require server-side processing to generate content on-the-fly. . Adding Dynamics to GitHub Pages . Through the use of JavaScript and the fetch of data through APIs (backed by servers), developers are able to customize GitHub Pages to support data change. As we explore the portfolio_2025, we will see JavaScript games, login systems, and data that appear very dynamic. . Nighthawk Pages . While this introduction covers the basics of creating static content with GitHub Pages, our classroom GitHub Pages will delve deeper into more advanced topics. We will explore how to integrate dynamic content, use advanced JavaScript techniques, and leverage APIs to create more interactive and engaging web pages. . . Markdown to HTML . This notebook will describe and show code fragments to help get the student developer ready for coding and committing changes to GitHub. . All the documents we have been discussing to this point in time were primarily written as ipynb documents that were converted to md. Each md file is converted to an html file. . Since HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the only files understood by the common web browsers, you will see the _site directory being constructed and updated every time we run make. Those primary browser files and content (ie images) are the only file types that end up in the site directory. . GitHub Pages index.md . In GitHub Pages you can define code in Markdown. The index.md uses markdown to define a page about CompSci courses at Del Norte High School. This pages is entirely markdoown and contains static references to images, that are in the images directory. . Markdown fragment. . Here is a small markdown fragment that was a part of the index.md at one time. . markdown ## Build your Home Page here # Investing in your Technical Future &gt; Explore the Computer Science Pathway at Del Norte High School and invest in your technical skills.

Images . In GitHub Pages, you can insert images in HTML or Markdown. . There are many image examples using markdown in the index.md file, this are reading content from the images directory. . The Teacher finds the HTML &lt;img&gt; easier to work with for embedding links when it is necessary to control size. This example shows Markdown syntax for embedding images, but students can also use HTML syntax with the tag. . See index.md for ![]() syntax for images, or reference Markdown images . | Or use “img” tage referencing HTML images . | . Becoming a Web Developer . Let’s say we wanted to share the key languages we are studying in a blog article about tools and equipment. Notice that the only the first image is in this example and it is kind of big.

Multiple Ways of Coding . The script tag in the running example above contains JavaScript. This JavaScript is written in a style that is similar to other languages like Java and Python, making it easier for developers familiar with those languages to understand. However, be aware that code can be written in many styles, some of which may not be as friendly to the syntax of other coding languages. . JavaScript is unique in its style and html usages that are shown in this example. The interaction of JavaScript with these tags and its operation within a web browser is its unique purpose. As JavaScript and other languages develop their niches, they start to vary in aspects like syntax. . A pure JavaScript programmer might write the script section differently. Therefore, when you watch a coding video or request code from a chatbot, the code might vary, but the different coding styles and syntax changes essentially achieve the same result. . Connecting to the HTML Container: The container declaration connects to the HTML element with the ID grid_container. | . | Defining Data: The http_source holds the base URL for the flag images. | The living_in_the_world array contains objects representing different locations, each with a flag URL, greeting, and description. | . | Building Grid Items: The loop iterates over each location in the living_in_the_world array. | For each location, a new div element with the class grid-item is created. | An img element is created for the flag, with the src attribute set to data from the living_in_the_world array. | Two p elements are created for the description and greeting. | These elements are appended to the gridItem div, which is then appended to the container div. | . | The code and examples showcase the use of modern JavaScript features to create a dynamic grid of items based on an array of data. . Modern JavaScript Features . This example demonstrates several modern JavaScript features that are prevalent in contemporary JavaScript codebases. . const for Variable Declarations: The const keyword is used for variable declarations, indicating that the variable’s value will not change throughout the script. This is useful for defining constants and ensuring immutability. | Arrow Functions: Arrow functions are used in the forEach loop. They provide a concise syntax for writing functions and are popular in functional programming styles. | Template Literals: Template literals are used for string concatenation. They allow for embedding expressions within strings using backticks (`) and ${} syntax. This can make the code more readable and easier to write by keeping the evaluation and the string in close proximity, reducing the cognitive load on the developer. | . &lt;script&gt; // 1.

Classic for Loop Example . This example contains a classic for loop that is common to almost every programming language. It demonstrates a traditional approach to iterating over an array and building HTML elements dynamically. . Three-Part For Loop: Uses the three-part for loop structure: initialization of the index (i), loop comparison, and index increment. | Variable Declaration with let: Uses let to define i, a variable that changes as the code logic progresses. | . &lt;script&gt; // 1.

            "content": "Computers and Terminals . A brief overview of Terminal and Linux is a step on your way to becoming a Linux expert. When a computer boots up, a kernel (MacOS, Windows, Linux) is started. This kernel is the core of the operating system and manages hardware resources. Above the kernel, various applications run, including the shell and terminal, which allow users to interact with the system using a basic set of commands provided by the kernel. . Typically, casual users interact with the system through a Desktop User Interface (UI) that is started by the computer’s boot-up processes. However, to interact directly with the shell, users can run a “terminal” application through the Desktop UI. Additionally, VS Code provides the ability to activate a “terminal” within its editing environment, making it convenient for developers to execute commands without leaving the code editor. . In this next phase, we will use a Jupyter notebook to perform Linux commands through a terminal. The Jupyter notebook is an application that runs above the kernel, providing an interactive environment for writing and executing code, including shell commands. This setup allows us to seamlessly integrate code execution, data analysis, and documentation in one place, enhancing our productivity and learning experience. . Setup a Personal GitHub Pages Project . You will be making a personal copy of the course repository. Be sure to have a GitHub account!!! . Use the Green “Use this Template” button on the portfolio_2025 repository page to set up your personal GitHub Pages repository. | Create a new repository. | Fill in the dialog and select the Repository Name to be under your GitHub ID ownership. . . | After this is complete, use the Green “Code” button on the newly created repository page to capture your “Project Repo” name. | . In the next few code cells, we will run a bash (shell) script to pull a GitHub project. . Shell Script and Variables . We will ultimately run a bash (shell) script to pull a GitHub project. This next script simply sets up the necessary environment variables to tell the script the location of repository from GitHub and where to copy the output. . For now, focus on each line that begins with export. These are shell variables. Each line has a name (after the keyword export) and a value (after the equal sign). . Here is a full description: . Creates a temporary file /tmp/variables.sh to store environment variables. | Sets the project_dir variable to your home directory with a subdirectory named nighthawk. You can change nighthawk to a different name to test your git clone. | Sets the project variable to a subdirectory within project_dir named portfolio_2025. You can change portfolio_2025 to the name of your project. | Sets the project_repo variable to the URL of the GitHub repository. Change this to the project you created from the portfolio_2025 template. | . By running this script, you will prepare your environment for cloning and working on your GitHub project. This is an essential step in setting up your development environment and ensuring that all dependencies are correctly configured. . %%script bash # Dependency Variables, set to match your project directories cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /tmp/variables.sh export project_dir=$HOME/nighthawk # change nighthawk to different name to test your git clone export project= $project_dir/mirabellea_2025 # change mirabellea_2025 to name of project from git clone export project_repo=&quot;https://github.com/mirabelle2025/mirabellea_2025.git&quot; # change to project you created from portfolio_2025 template EOF . Describing the Outputs of the Variables . The next script will extract the saved variables and display their values. Here is a description of the commands: . The source command loads the variables that we saved in the /tmp/variables.sh file in the previous code cell. | The echo commands display the contents of the named variables: project_dir: The directory where your project is located. | project: The specific project directory within project_dir. | project_repo: The URL of the GitHub repository. | . | . By running this script, you can verify that the environment variables are correctly set in your development environment. If they don’t match up, go back to the previous code cell and make the necessary corrections. . %%script bash # Extract saved variables source /tmp/variables.sh # Output shown title and value variables echo &quot;Project dir: $project_dir&quot; echo &quot;Project: $project&quot; echo &quot;Repo: $project_repo&quot; . Project dir: /home/mirabelle2025/nighthawk Project: /home/mirabelle2025/nighthawk/mirabellea_2025 Repo: https://github.com/mirabelle2025/mirabellea_2025.git . Project Setup and Analysis with Bash Scripts . The bash scripts that follow automate what was done in the Tools Installation procedures with regards to cloning a GitHub project. Doing this in a script fashion adds the following benefits: . After completing these steps, we will have notes on how to set up and verify a project. | By reviewing these commands, you will start to learn the basics of Linux. | By setting up these code cells, you will be learning how to develop automated scripts using Shell programming. | You will learn that pretty much anything we type on a computer can be automated through the use of variables and a coding language. | . Pull Code . Pull code from GitHub to your machine. This is a bash script, a sequence of commands, that will create a project directory and add the “project” from GitHub to the vscode directory. There is conditional logic to make sure that the clone only happens if it does not (!) exist. Here are some key elements in this code: . cd command (change directory), remember this from the terminal session. | if statements (conditional statements, called selection statements by College Board), code inside only happens if the condition is met. | . Run the script two times and you will see that the output changes. In the second run, the files exist and it impact the flow of the code. . %%script bash # Extract saved variables source /tmp/variables.sh echo &quot;Using conditional statement to create a project directory and project&quot; cd ~ # start in home directory # Conditional block to make a project directory if [ ! -d $project_dir ] then echo &quot;Directory $project_dir does not exist... making directory $project_dir&quot; mkdir -p $project_dir fi echo &quot;Directory $project_dir exists.&quot; # Conditional block to git clone a project from project_repo if [ ! -d $project ] then echo &quot;Directory $project does not exist... cloning $project_repo&quot; cd $project_dir git clone $project_repo cd ~ fi echo &quot;Directory $project exists.&quot; . Using conditional statement to create a project directory and project Directory /home/mirabelle2025/nighthawk exists. Directory /home/mirabelle2025/nighthawk/mirabellea_2025 exists. . Look at Files in GitHub Project . All computers contain files and directories. The clone brought more files from the cloud to your machine. Review the bash shell script, observe the commands that show and interact with files and directories. These were used during setup. . ls lists computer files in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. | cd offers a way to navigate and change the working directory. | pwd prints the working directory. | echo is used to display a line of text/string that is passed as an argument. | . %%script bash # Extract saved variables source /tmp/variables.sh echo &quot;Navigate to project, then navigate to area wwhere files were cloned&quot; cd $project pwd echo &quot;&quot; echo &quot;list top level or root of files with project pulled from github&quot; ls .

It offers a wide range of resources including tech talks, code examples, and educational blogs. GitHub Pages can be customized by the blogger to support computer science learnings as the student works through the pathway of using Javascript, Python/Flask, Java/Spring. ## Student Requirements Del Norte HS students will be required to review their personal GitHub Pages at each midterm and final. This review will contain a compilation of personal work performed within each significant grading period. In general, Students and Teachers are expected to use GitHub pages to build lessons, complete classroom hacks, perform work on JavaScript games, and serve as a frontend to full-stack applications. Exchange of information could be: 1. sharing a file: `wget &quot;raw-link.ipynb&quot; 2. creating a template from this repository 3. sharing a fork among team members 4. etc. ## History This project is in its 3rd revision (aka 3.0). The project was initially based on Fastpages. But this project has diverged from those roots into an independent entity. The decision to separate from Fastpages was influenced by the deprecation of Fastpages by authors. It is believed by our community that the authors of fastpages turned toward Quatro. After that change of direction fastpages did not align with the Teacher&#39;s goals and student needs. The Nighthawk Pages project has more of a raw development blogging need. ### License The Apache license has its roots in Fastpages. Thus, it carries its license forward. However, most of the code is likely unrecognizable from those roots. ### Key Features - **Code Examples**: Provides practical coding examples in JavaScript, including a platformer game, and frontend code for user databases using Python and Java backends. - **Educational Blogs**: Offers instructional content on various topics such as developer tools setup, deployment on AWS, SQL databases, machine learning, and data structures. It utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for interactive lessons and coding challenges. - **Tools and Integrations**: Features GitHub actions for blog publishing, Utterances for blog commenting, local development support via Makefile and scripts, and styling with the Minima Theme and SASS. It also includes a new integration with GitHub Projects and Issues. ### Contributions - **Notable Contributions**: Highlights significant contributions to the project, including theme development, search and tagging functionality, GitHub API integration, and the incorporation of GitHub Projects into GitHub pages. Contributors such as Tirth Thakker, Mirza Beg, and Toby Ledder have played crucial roles in these developments. - **Blog Contributions**: Often students contribute articles and blogs to this project. Their names are typically listed in the front matter of their contributing post. ## GitHub Pages setup The absolutes in setup up... **Activate GitHub Pages Actions**: This step involves enabling GitHub Pages Actions for your project. By doing so, your project will be automatically deployed using GitHub Pages Actions, ensuring that your project is always up to date with the latest changes you push to your repository. - On the GitHub website for the repository go to the menu: Settings -&gt; Pages -&gt;Build - Under the Deployment location on the page, select &quot;GitHub Actions&quot;. **Update `_config.yml`**: You need to modify the `_config.yml` file to reflect your repository&#39;s name. This configuration is crucial because it ensures that your project&#39;s styling is correctly applied, making your deployed site look as intended rather than unstyled or broken. text github_repo: &quot;student_2025&quot; baseurl: &quot;/student_2025&quot; **Set Repository Name in Makefile**: Adjust the `REPO_NAME` variable in your Makefile to match your GitHub repository&#39;s name. This action facilitates the automatic updating of posts and notebooks on your local development server, improving the development process. make # Configuration, override port with usage: make PORT=4200 PORT ?= 4100 REPO_NAME ?= student_2025 LOG_FILE = /tmp/jekyll$(PORT).log ### Tool requirements All `GitHub Pages` websites are managed on GitHub infrastructure and use GitHub version control. Each time we change files in GitHub it initiates a GitHub Action, a continuous integration and development toolset, that rebuilds and publishes the site with Jekyll. - GitHub uses `Jekyll` to transform your markdown and HTML content into static websites and blogs. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). - A Linux shell is required to work with this project integration with GitHub Pages, GitHub and VSCode. Ubuntu is the preferred shell, though MacOS shell is supported as well. There will be some key setup scripts that follow in the README. - Visual Studio Code is the Nighthawk Pages author&#39;s preferred code editor and extensible development environment. VSCode has a rich ecosystem of developer extensions that ease working with GitHub Pages, GitHub, and many programming languages. Setting up VSCode and extensions will be elaborated upon in this document. - An anatomy section in this README will describe GitHub Pages and conventions that are used to organize content and files. This includes file names, key coding files, metadata tagging of blogs, styling tooling for blogs, etc. ### Development Environment Setup Comprehensive start. A topic-by-topic guide to getting this project running is published [here](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/portfolio_2025/devops/tools/home). Quick start. A quick start below is a reminder, but is dependent on your knowledge. Only follow this instruction if you need a refresher. Always default to the comprehensive start if any problem occurs. #### Clone Repo Run these commands to obtain the project, then locate into the project directory with the terminal, install an extensive set of tools, and make. bash git clone &lt;this-repo&gt; # git clone https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/student_2025.git cd &lt;repo-dir&gt;/scripts # cd student_2025 #### Windows WSL and/or Ubuntu Users - Execute the script: `./activate_ubuntu.sh` #### macOS Users - Execute the script: `./activate_macos.sh` #### Kasm Cloud Desktop Users - Execute the script: `./activate.sh` ## Run Server on localhost To preview the project you will need to &quot;make&quot; the project. ### Bundle install The very first time you clone run project you will need to run this Ruby command as the final part of your setup. bash bundle install ### Start the Server This requires running terminal commands `make`, `make stop`, `make clean`, or `make convert` to manage the running server. Logging of details will appear in the terminal. A `Makefile` has been created in the project to support commands and start processes. Start the server, this is the best choice for initial and iterative development. Note. after the initial `make`, you should see files automatically refresh in the terminal on VSCode save. bash make ### Load web application into the Browser Start the preview server in the terminal, The terminal output from `make` shows the server address. &quot;Cmd&quot; or &quot;Ctl&quot; click the http location to open the preview server in a browser. Here is an example Server address message, click on the Server address to load:... text http://0.0.0.0:4100/student_2025/ ### Regeneration of web application Save on &quot;.ipynb&quot; or &quot;.md&quot; file activiates &quot;regeneration&quot;. An example terminal message is below. Refresh the browser to see updates after the message displays. text Regenerating: 1 file(s) changed at 2023-07-31 06:54:32 _notebooks/2024-01-04-cockpit-setup.ipynb ### Other &quot;make&quot; commands Terminal messages are generated from background processes. At any time, click return or enter in a terminal window to obtain a prompt. Once you have the prompt you can use the terminal as needed for other tasks. Always return to the root of project `cd ~/vscode/student_2025` for all &quot;make&quot; actions. #### Stop the preview server Stopping the server ends the web server applications running process. However, it leaves constructed files in the project in a ready state for the next time you run `make`. bash make stop ### Clean the local web application environment This command will top the server and &quot;clean&quot; all previously constructed files (ie .ipynb -&gt; .md). This is the best choice when renaming files has created duplicates that are visible when previewing work. bash make clean ### Observe build errors Test Jupyter Notebook conversions (ie .ipynb -&gt; .md), this is the best choice to see if an IPYNB conversion error is occurring. bash make convert ## Development Support ### File Names in &quot;_posts&quot;, &quot;_notebooks&quot; There are two primary directories for creating blogs. The &quot;_posts&quot; directory is for authoring in markdown only. The &quot;_notebooks&quot; allows for markdown, pythons, javascript and more. To name a file, use the following structure (If dates are in the future, review your config.yml setting if you want them to be viewed). Review these naming conventions. - For markdown files in _posts: - year-month-day-fileName.md - GOOD EXAMPLE: 2021-08-02-First-Day.md - BAD EXAMPLE: 2021-8-2-first-day.md - BAD EXAMPLE: first-day.md - BAD EXAMPLE: 2069-12-31-First-Day.md - For Jupyter notebooks in _notebooks: - year-month-day-fileName.ipynb - GOOD EXAMPLE: 2021-08-02-First-Day.ipynb - BAD EXAMPLE: 2021-8-2-first-day.ipynb - BAD EXAMPLE: first-day.ipynb - BAD EXAMPLE: 2069-12-31-First-Day.ipynb ### Tags Tags are used to organize pages by their tag the way to add tags is to add the following to your front matter such as the example seen here `categories: [Tools]` Each item in the same category will be lumped together to be seen easily on the search page. ### Search All pages can be searched for using the built-in search bar. This search bar will search for any word in the title of a page or in the page itself. This allows for easily finding pages and information that you are looking for. However, sometimes this may not be desirable so to hide a page from the search you need to add `search_exclude: true` to the front matter of the page. This will hide the page from appearing when the viewer uses search. ### Navigation Bar To add pages to the top navigation bar use _config.yml to order and determine which menus you want and how to order them. Review the_config.yml in this project for an example. ### Blog Page There is a blog page that has options for images and a description of the page. This page can help the viewer understand what the page is about and what they can expect to find on the page. The way to add images to a page is to have the following front matter `image: /images/file.jpg` and then the name of the image that you want to use. The image must be in the `images` folder. Furthermore, if you would like the file to not show up on the blog page `hide: true` can be added to the front matter. ### SASS support NIGHTHAWK Pages support a variety of different themes that are each overlaid on top of minima. To use each theme, go to the &quot;_sass/minima/custom-styles.scss&quot; file and simply comment or uncomment the theme you want to use. To learn about the minima themes search for &quot;GitHub Pages minima&quot; and review the README. To find a new theme search for &quot;Github Pages Themes&quot;. ### Includes - Nighthawk Pages uses liquid syntax to import many common page elements that are present throughout the repository. These common elements are imported from the _includes directory. If you want to add one of these common elements, use liquid syntax to import the desired element to your file. Here’s an example of the liquid syntax used to import: `&lt;h3&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;post-link&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt; . &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;post-meta&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; ` Note that the liquid syntax is surrounded by curly braces and percent signs. This can be used anywhere in the repository. . ### Layouts - To use or create a custom page layout, make an HTML page inside the _layouts directory, and when you want to use that layout in a file, use the following front matter `layout: [your layout here]`. All layouts will be written in liquid to define the structure of the page. ### Metadata Metadata, also known as &quot;front matter&quot;, is a set of key-value pairs that can provide additional information to GitHub Pages about .md and .ipynb files. This can and probably will be used in other file types (ie doc, pdf) if we add them to the system. In the front matter, you can also define things like a title and description for the page. Additional front matter is defined to place content on the &quot;Computer Science Lab Notebook&quot; page. The `courses:` key will place data on a specific page with the nested `week:` placing data on a specific row on the page. The `type:` key in &quot;front matter&quot; will place the blog under the plans, hacks(ToDo), and tangibles columns. - In our files, the front matter is defined at the top of the page or the first markdown cell. - First, open one of the .md or .ipynb files already included in either your _posts|_notebooks folder. - In the .md file, you should notice something similar to this at the top of the page. To see this in your .ipynb files you will need to double-click the markdown cell at the top of the file. yaml toc: true comments: true layout: post title: Jupyter Python Sample description: Example Blog!!! This shows code and notes from hacks. type: ccc courses: { csa: {week: 5} } - The front matter will always have &#39;&#39; at the top and bottom to distinguish it and each key-value pair will be separated by a &#39;:&#39;. - Here we can modify things like the title and description. - The type value will tell us which column this is going to appear under the time box supported pages. The &quot;ccc&quot; stands for Code, Code, Code. - The courses will tell us which menu item it will be under, in this case, the `csa` menu, and the `week` tells it what row (week) it will appear under that menu. end of README.md . Env, Git, and GitHub . Env(ironment) is used to capture things like the path to the Code or Home directory. Git and GitHub are not only used to exchange code between individuals but are also often used to exchange code through servers, in our case for website deployment. All tools we use have behind-the-scenes relationships with the system they run on (MacOS, Windows, Linux) or a relationship with servers to which they are connected (e.g., GitHub). There is an “env” command in bash. There are environment files and setting files (e.g., .git/config) for Git. They both use a key/value concept. . env shows settings for your shell. | git clone sets up a directory of files. | cd $project allows the user to move inside that directory of files. | .git is a hidden directory that is used by Git to establish a relationship between the machine and the Git server on GitHub. | . %%script bash # This command has no dependencies echo &quot;Show the shell environment variables, key on left of equal value on right&quot; echo &quot;&quot; env .

Advanced Shell project . This example was requested by a student (Jun Lim, CSA). The request was to make a Jupyter file using bash; I adapted the request to markdown. This type of thought will have great extrapolation to coding and possibilities of using Lists, Arrays, or APIs to build user interfaces. JavaScript is a language where building HTML is very common. . To get more interesting output from the terminal, this will require using something like mdless (https://github.com/ttscoff/mdless). This enables seeing markdown in rendered format. . On Desktop Install PKG from MacPorts | In Terminal on MacOS Install ncurses | gem install mdless | . | . Output of the example is much nicer in “Jupyter” . This is starting the process of documentation. . %%script bash # This example has an error in VSCode; it runs best on Jupyter cd /tmp file=&quot;sample.md&quot; if [ -f &quot;$file&quot; ]; then rm $file fi # Create a markdown file using tee and here document (&lt;&lt;EOF) tee -a $file &gt;/dev/null &lt;&lt;EOF # Show Generated Markdown This introductory paragraph and this line and the title above are generated using tee with the standard input (&lt;&lt;) redirection operator. - This bulleted element is still part of the tee body.

Display Shell commands help using man . The previous example used a markdown file to store a list of actions and their descriptions. This example uses the man command to generate a markdown file with descriptions of the commands. The markdown file is then displayed using mdless. . In coding, we should try to get data from the content creators instead of creating it on our own. This approach has several benefits: . Accuracy: Descriptions from man pages are authoritative and accurate, as they come directly from the documentation provided by the command’s developers. | Consistency: Automatically generating descriptions ensures consistency in formatting and terminology. | Efficiency: It saves time and effort, especially when dealing with a large number of commands. | Up-to-date Information: man pages are regularly updated with the latest information, ensuring that the descriptions are current. | . %%script bash # This example has an error in VSCode; it runs best on Jupyter cd /tmp file=&quot;sample.md&quot; if [ -f &quot;$file&quot; ]; then rm $file fi # Set locale to C to avoid locale-related errors export LC_ALL=C # Create a markdown file using tee and here document (&lt;&lt;EOF) tee -a $file &gt;/dev/null &lt;&lt;EOF # Show Generated Markdown This introductory paragraph and this line and the title above are generated using tee with the standard input (&lt;&lt;) redirection operator. - This bulleted element is still part of the tee body.

Be mindful that different workspaces will have distinct setup and installation requirements. However, after the initial setup, we will aim to make our workspaces as similar as possible. . . Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) Setup . WSL provides a Linux terminal environment on a Windows computer. Linux is an open-source operating system with many distributions, such as Ubuntu Linux, which we will install and use. Once we install Ubuntu Linux, we will be able to run Linux/Unix commands. Ubuntu includes a package manager called apt that allows us to add developer packages and libraries to the machine. . To get started, download WSL and Ubuntu 22.04: . Open PowerShell as an administrator (Right-click -&gt; Run as administrator) and type: wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04 . | After the installation finishes, restart your computer. . | After restarting, a command prompt or PowerShell prompt may automatically open, asking for a username. Enter a username and password to create your account. Note, that the password will not be visible as you type, but it is still being registered. . If no prompt opens, open PowerShell as an administrator and run: wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04 . | Open Command Prompt or PowerShell as a regular user (just click on Command Prompt or PowerShell), and type wsl. The terminal’s prompt should change from PS C: Users &lt;username&gt; to &lt;username&gt;@MSI:. You are now ready to use Linux/Unix commands. . | To set Ubuntu 22.04 as the default WSL distribution, run: wsl --set-default Ubuntu-22.04 . | WSL (Reference, shows WSL commands) .

            "content": "Personal Identifiable Information (PII) . When creating accounts for this course, it’s important to understand what personal identifiable information (PII) is and how and what to protect. PII includes any information that can be used to identify you. . In this course, in some cases we will ask you share or build the value PII. We hope to do it in a good way. . Why PII Matters . Websites like LinkedIn are places where we want to showcase our accomplishments. We intend to advertise PII. . As individuals and a society, sometimes we are willing spread our PII through sites like TikTok, Reddit, X, Instagram or Facebook. This often provides satisfaction, some refer to it as the dopamine effect. Sometimes we are proud of what we advertise, sometime us or others wish they could retract the information shared. . In our society, all the accounts mentioned above become part of our PII. . Types of PII . Public Information: These are details that are generally known and shared: Name | Email (consider using a secondary email) | Picture | High School and College attended | Properties you own | State and City of residence | Previous residences | Credit Reports | Home router location | . | Sensitive Information: Be more cautious with these details: Full birth date | Place of Birth | Street Address | Phone Number | Maiden names of Mother or Grandmother | Driver’s License Number | . | Highly Confidential Information: Keep these absolutely secret: Internet Access Credentials | Google key store | Two-Factor Authentication sources | Social Security Number | . | . Techniques to Increase Security . Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Use systems that require a code sent to your phone or email. | Biometrics: Secure your devices with fingerprints or facial recognition. | Asymmetric Cryptography: Understand that public-key cryptography uses a pair of keys (one public, one private) to encrypt and decrypt messages. This is used in SSL for secure websites (aka https://). | Strong Passwords: Use complex and unique passwords for different accounts. Consider using a password manager to keep track of them. | Regular Software Updates: Keep your operating system, applications, and antivirus software up to date to protect against the latest threats. | Secure Home Router: Create a strong password for your home router to ensure it is not easily compromised from the internet. | Secure Wi-Fi: Use strong passwords for your home Wi-Fi network to ensure it is not easily accessed by others in proximity (e.g., the stree). Consider using a VPN when accessing Wi-Fi in public places (e.g., coffee shops). | Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data on your devices and backups to protect it from unauthorized access. | . Be Aware of Internet Threats . Viruses and Malware: These compromise security and are often spread through email attachments. | Phishing: Be cautious of attempts to get your information through deceptive emails or websites. | Social Engineering: Be aware of tactics used to manipulate you into divulging confidential information. | Post-Incident Actions: If compromised, review and secure all vulnerabilities immediately. Revise and update your PII plan to prevent future incidents. | . By understanding and protecting your PII, you can safely navigate the digital world and keep sensitive and highly confidentail personal information secure. . Nighthawk Coders Accounts . In this class, we will advise you to create several accounts. Additionally, we will request that you publish a public-facing name and email on some of these accounts. . Email Accounts . You will be using and sharing email accounts with the teacher and fellow students. . A strategy I employ is maintaining different email accounts according to the expected type or volume of information (junk email, common email, work/school email, important email). This is not about security, but it helps set an expectation for the “purpose,” “value,” or “importance” of information aggregated to that endpoint. . GitHub Account . We want you to create a GitHub account. You will need to establish a GitHub user ID, username, and email. This can include one or more email accounts. We will ask that you make a name and email public. This account will be your social media account as a coder. . We suggest that you use a “junk” or “common” email account for this platform. We recommend that you don’t use your school email. . The email you make public should be in the same category as what you would share on more professional social media accounts, i.e., in the “common” or “junk” category. . GitHub Pages . We will ask you to publish a Student Portfolio using GitHub Pages. This will be a public website and will be indexed by Google and Google Analytics. . Slack Account . We will ask you to create an account on Slack, which will require PII. We suggest that you use a “junk” or “common” email account for this platform. We recommend that you don’t use your school email. . PII in this category should be restricted to the teacher and fellow students. This includes students from the past, as we have allowed this to be open to those who were formerly enrolled. There are different Slack workspaces for CSSE, CSP, and CSA. . Portfolio 2025 Account . We will ask you to create a user account based on your GitHub user ID. This will be used to build course lists, provide compute services (e.g., AWS, KASM), and aggregate analytics for the teacher. . PII in this category should be restricted to the teacher and fellow students. This includes students from the past, as we have allowed this to be open to those who were formerly enrolled. . PII Strategy on Account Creation . It is in the teacher’s interest that you establish and continually refine your PII (Personal Identifiable Information) strategy. It is likely that you are already active in sharing common PII, considering for yourself what is OK to share. As you progress in the digital world, you will likely need to adapt. . Key Points to Consider: . Categorize Information: Public Information: Information you are comfortable sharing publicly, such as your name and general interests. | Sensitive Information: Information that should be shared cautiously, such as your full birth date and phone number. | Highly Confidential Information: Information that should be kept strictly private, such as your social security number and internet access credentials. | . | Use Different Email Accounts: Maintain different email accounts for different purposes (e.g., junk email, common email, work/school email, important email). This helps manage the type and volume of information you receive and sets expectations for the importance of the information. | . | Be Prepared for Security Incidents: Anticipate that you may be hacked and will need to secure any vulnerabilities. Regularly update your passwords and use multi-factor authentication where possible. | . | Adapt and Evolve: As you gain more experience and your digital footprint grows, continually reassess and adapt your PII strategy to ensure it remains effective. | . | Parting Advice: . As you create and manage your accounts, always be mindful of the information you are sharing. Protecting your PII is an ongoing process that requires vigilance and adaptability. By categorizing your information, using different email accounts, and preparing for potential security incidents, you can better safeguard your personal information. . Remember, the digital world is constantly evolving, and so should your approach to managing your PII. Stay informed about the latest security practices and be proactive in protecting your digital identity. Your future self will thank you for the precautions you take today. .",

The provided text text is a comprehensive framework for evaluating students in a Computer Science Project-based learning course, focusing on a broad spectrum of criteria beyond traditional assignment grades. This framework encompasses both soft skills and technical abilities, aiming to create a holistic profile of each student’s performance and growth. . Focus and Intentions: This category assesses students’ general attitudes and behaviors towards learning, including attendance, work habits, behavior, timeliness, and prerequisite knowledge. It emphasizes the importance of consistent participation, productive work ethics, adaptability, and preparedness for the course. . | Technical Progression: This section evaluates students’ development of technical skills and understanding over the course. It includes assessments of their initial technical sensibility, their ability to clearly present and explain technical concepts, and their growth in technical expertise as they prepare for significant milestones like the AP exam. . | Soft Skills and Presentation: This area focuses on students’ interpersonal and self-management skills, including self-advocacy, communication and collaboration, leadership, and integrity. It highlights the importance of effective communication, teamwork, leadership potential, and ethical behavior in both academic and professional settings. . | . The framework suggests that each student’s performance is evaluated not just on their academic achievements but also on their work habits, technical skills, and soft skills. This approach aims to provide a more comprehensive assessment of students’ readiness for future challenges in Data Science and related fields. . Habits and Ongoing Evaluations . In any course, “Grade”, is not the only assessment that is on a report card. A Student, on a daily basis, establishes work behaviors and demonstrates capabilities with a Teacher. . As an employee, on a daily basis, an individual establishes work behaviors with peers and manager. Sometimes managers document behaviors. As Data Science improves, employers are constantly considering bnd re-considering etter techniques for monitoring employee work. . In this course, will be establishing a Data Science profile 1/0, or a ratio, for each students, this profile will be maintained by Teacher and will be complemented by the sytems we use. The course will be using these ratios in evaluating the grade and other assesment criteria for each students project and final report card. . Focus, Intentions . Attendance: Does the student have a computer every day, were they tardy, or did they have any irregularities in presence; like being gone for 1/2 hour bathroom breaks, consistently missing intro sessions to class, … . | Work Habits: Does the student have a class time work ethic or in Teacher perception appears to be productive; do they have collaboration meetings with pair and team? do they do their own work in class time? do the follow a plan? are the open to change? are the improving habits? are their work habits a positive to those around them?… . | Behavior: Does the student require redirection from Teacher to be on task? are they active and appropriately participating in Tech Talks? are they actively trying to win habit points? are they focussing on the right things at the right time? do they have grit and persistence? do they avoid distractions like phones, ear phones, head phones, paper? … . | Timeliness: Is the student ready to participate in live reviews? are they aware of assignments requirements and due dates? is their work outcome in alignment with assignment expectation? are they on track with work and showing progress? is progress consistent with time period, expectations, and Teacher assessed capabilities? do they keep ahead of the projects? do they avoid last day, last minute work? …. . | Qualified, satisfies pre-requisites: Teacher assessment on if the Student was qualified to take class. For instance, some CSA students skip CSP and have had no previous background in CompSci. Another case, is the student a “good student”; someone that completes tasks and accomplishes goals; someone that is prepared to work in class and do homework; is the student able to identify their needs and learning style requirements; do they participate; do they ask questions; will they review visuals; talk about problems; attend office hours; Finally, is the student progressing and futher qualify themself through the year; is the student carrying skills from earlier sprints into current sprint. . | . | Technical Progression . Tech sense: Teacher assesment on the “technical sense or sensibility” when entering the class and each sprint throughout the year. For instance, in the beginning is student able to navigate their own computer, locate files, install software? Or as they progress through year are they able to use their tools, perform tool updates, keep things working, troubleshoot? Are they able to navigate through technical elements? Over time, will they adapt and try to improve efficiency? … . | Tech talk: Does the student show the ability to explain what they have been working on? Are the able to describe technical elements with correct vocabulary? Are they able to understand technological jargon, understand the technical frameworks in order to explain it to others? Are they confident and prepared? … . | Tech growth: Teacher assesment on “technical rating” as the student progresses in class or prepares to take the AP exam. Did the student acquire technical abilities in each Sprint prior to AP exam? Does the student learn the Tech, or do they simply try for the points? Is the student building on skills learned as foundations for the next task? At the time of the AP exam time, did the Teacher believe that they would undoubtedly receive a “3” or higher? . | . | Soft Skills, Presentation . Self advocacy: Teacher assesment and perception on how the student self advocates. Does the student effectively communicate, convey, negotiate or assert interests, desires, needs? Does the student seek out help when needed? Does the student ask questions on Slack, in person, of team members? Does the student attend Tutorial? Is the student aware and informed of assignments? Does student make informed decisions and take responsibility for their own decisions? . | Comm and Collab skills: Teacher assesment and perception on whether the student is a collaborator and communicator in classroom. Does the Teacher see the student exhibiting collaboritive behaviors? Does student explain and review work with others? Do they work consistently plan work with others? Are communication and collaboration behaviors a willing and active attributes in the students persona? Does the Teacher observe the student as active in communication during live reviews? . | Integrity: Teacher assesment on how the student represents their own work and behavior. Does the student have a general sense of self-awareness, group-awareness, and how actions impact others? Does the student and student group respect and follow the rules established in the classroom and by the Teacher? Without question, did the student do their own work on each assignment and throughout the grading period? In live reviews, did the Teacher think the student was misrepresenting work as their own? Did the student stand-by silently as other were presenting, silence usually means coat-tailing in hope for credit? Was there questionable behavior that was not atoned, for instance being a suspect or caught in cheating scandal? . | Organized: Teacher assesment or observation on organization and leadership qualities of the student. Did the Teacher observe the student as having key leadership and organization skills? Did the Teacher see time management skills exhibited by the student, including creating work issues and schedules, finding the in-between time for things that are not part of the norm? Did the student exhibit networking, critical thiking, and proactivity? Did the Teacher see excellence and the student to take on a technical or leadership position in the classroom? Did the student follow through with that responsibiility? Would the Teacher or did the Teacher ask the student to perform a task important to the entire classroom? . | . | .

Establish PBL and Comp Sci attitude; often called an Agile Mindset or Growth Mindset. Here are some elements you could add to start your blog. . Watch a video How I Would Learn To Code. Record some thoughts. | Attitude. An Agile/Growth mindset is not knowing the answer, making lots of mistakes and performing iteration. A successful grade is dependent on making mistakes, research, asking questions, and continual iteration. Record some mistakes you made and then show the resulting corrections. | Tools and Equipment. Highlight some items you learned from the tools setup. Why do you think bringing a personal laptop or Chromebook to class daily is so important? Comment on how the Internet, AP Classroom, ChatGPT, and Nighthawk Coders website will be considered as a textbook. | Requirements. Everything will be distributed electronically. All code you develop will be delivered to the Cloud. No paper! | Grading guidelines. Write your interpretation of this paragraph in your blog. There will be key technical objectives that will require producing tangibles aka tangible artifacts. Essentially, it is impossible to be late with work if you work consistently attend class, work in class and turn in progressive tangibles each week. Thus, failure to have work will result in a point deduction. Additionally, late work must be defended during office hours and will receive a 10% deduction or more. | Understanding point scale. Write your interpretation of the below in your blog. A High “A” is very tough to achieve, something beyond the given requirements. Something that exhibits an unforced desire to learn and Code/Code/Code beyond. A series of these types of grades is required to earn a Teacher recommendation for College. Low “A” is consistency in producing tangibles toward Team Project and Individual GH Page according to Issues and Scrum Board plans. Plans must be consistent with key objectives and technicals. | “B” is having flaws in consistency or tangible shortcomings, but mostly on track. A flaw would be mostly working code, and attempts, but an incomplete assignment. | “C” is a lack of consistent effort, lacking tangibles. Lack of producing running Code. | Below “C” is composed of Slash/Slash/Slash offenses. Lack of attendance, disruptive behaviors, using phone inappropriately, doing work from other classes during CompSci class time, paper visible in class, and turning in “tangibles” that you can’t represent in live review. | Zero is a result of plagiarism.

It offers a wide range of resources including tech talks, code examples, and educational blogs. . GitHub Pages can be customized by the blogger to support computer science learnings as the student works through the pathway of using Javascript, Python/Flask, Java/Spring. . Student Requirements . Del Norte HS students will be required to review their personal GitHub Pages at each midterm and final. This review will contain a compilation of personal work performed within each significant grading period. . In general, Students and Teachers are expected to use GitHub pages to build lessons, complete classroom hacks, perform work on JavaScript games, and serve as a frontend to full-stack applications. . Exchange of information could be: . sharing a file: `wget “raw-link.ipynb” | creating a template from this repository | sharing a fork among team members | etc. | . History . This project is in its 3rd revision (aka 3.0). . The project was initially based on Fastpages. But this project has diverged from those roots into an independent entity. The decision to separate from Fastpages was influenced by the deprecation of Fastpages by authors. It is believed by our community that the authors of fastpages turned toward Quatro. After that change of direction fastpages did not align with the Teacher’s goals and student needs. The Nighthawk Pages project has more of a raw development blogging need. . License . The Apache license has its roots in Fastpages. Thus, it carries its license forward. However, most of the code is likely unrecognizable from those roots. . Key Features . Code Examples: Provides practical coding examples in JavaScript, including a platformer game, and frontend code for user databases using Python and Java backends. | Educational Blogs: Offers instructional content on various topics such as developer tools setup, deployment on AWS, SQL databases, machine learning, and data structures. It utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for interactive lessons and coding challenges. | Tools and Integrations: Features GitHub actions for blog publishing, Utterances for blog commenting, local development support via Makefile and scripts, and styling with the Minima Theme and SASS. It also includes a new integration with GitHub Projects and Issues. | . Contributions . Notable Contributions: Highlights significant contributions to the project, including theme development, search and tagging functionality, GitHub API integration, and the incorporation of GitHub Projects into GitHub pages. Contributors such as Tirth Thakker, Mirza Beg, and Toby Ledder have played crucial roles in these developments. . | Blog Contributions: Often students contribute articles and blogs to this project. Their names are typically listed in the front matter of their contributing post. . | . . GitHub Pages setup . The absolutes in setup up… . Activate GitHub Pages Actions: This step involves enabling GitHub Pages Actions for your project. By doing so, your project will be automatically deployed using GitHub Pages Actions, ensuring that your project is always up to date with the latest changes you push to your repository. . On the GitHub website for the repository go to the menu: Settings -&gt; Pages -&gt;Build | Under the Deployment location on the page, select “GitHub Actions”. | . Update _config.yml: You need to modify the _config.yml file to reflect your repository’s name. This configuration is crucial because it ensures that your project’s styling is correctly applied, making your deployed site look as intended rather than unstyled or broken. . github_repo: &quot;student_2025&quot; baseurl: &quot;/student_2025&quot; . Set Repository Name in Makefile: Adjust the REPO_NAME variable in your Makefile to match your GitHub repository’s name. This action facilitates the automatic updating of posts and notebooks on your local development server, improving the development process. . # Configuration, override port with usage: make PORT=4200 PORT ?= 4100 REPO_NAME ?= student_2025 LOG_FILE = /tmp/jekyll$(PORT).log . Tool requirements . All GitHub Pages websites are managed on GitHub infrastructure and use GitHub version control. Each time we change files in GitHub it initiates a GitHub Action, a continuous integration and development toolset, that rebuilds and publishes the site with Jekyll. . GitHub uses Jekyll to transform your markdown and HTML content into static websites and blogs. Jekyll. | A Linux shell is required to work with this project integration with GitHub Pages, GitHub and VSCode. Ubuntu is the preferred shell, though MacOS shell is supported as well. There will be some key setup scripts that follow in the README. | Visual Studio Code is the Nighthawk Pages author’s preferred code editor and extensible development environment. VSCode has a rich ecosystem of developer extensions that ease working with GitHub Pages, GitHub, and many programming languages. Setting up VSCode and extensions will be elaborated upon in this document. | An anatomy section in this README will describe GitHub Pages and conventions that are used to organize content and files. This includes file names, key coding files, metadata tagging of blogs, styling tooling for blogs, etc. | . Development Environment Setup . Comprehensive start. A topic-by-topic guide to getting this project running is published here. . Quick start. A quick start below is a reminder, but is dependent on your knowledge. Only follow this instruction if you need a refresher. Always default to the comprehensive start if any problem occurs. . Clone Repo . Run these commands to obtain the project, then locate into the project directory with the terminal, install an extensive set of tools, and make. . git clone &lt;this-repo&gt; # git clone https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/student_2025.git cd &lt;repo-dir&gt;/scripts # cd student_2025 . Windows WSL and/or Ubuntu Users . Execute the script: ./activate_ubuntu.sh | . macOS Users . Execute the script: ./activate_macos.sh | . Kasm Cloud Desktop Users . Execute the script: ./activate.sh | . Run Server on localhost . To preview the project you will need to “make” the project. . Bundle install . The very first time you clone run project you will need to run this Ruby command as the final part of your setup. . bundle install . Start the Server . This requires running terminal commands make, make stop, make clean, or make convert to manage the running server. Logging of details will appear in the terminal. A Makefile has been created in the project to support commands and start processes. . Start the server, this is the best choice for initial and iterative development. Note. after the initial make, you should see files automatically refresh in the terminal on VSCode save. . make . Load web application into the Browser . Start the preview server in the terminal, The terminal output from make shows the server address. “Cmd” or “Ctl” click the http location to open the preview server in a browser. Here is an example Server address message, click on the Server address to load:… . http://0.0.0.0:4100/student_2025/ . Regeneration of web application . Save on “.ipynb” or “.md” file activiates “regeneration”. An example terminal message is below. Refresh the browser to see updates after the message displays. . Regenerating: 1 file(s) changed at 2023-07-31 06:54:32 _notebooks/2024-01-04-cockpit-setup.ipynb . Other “make” commands . Terminal messages are generated from background processes. At any time, click return or enter in a terminal window to obtain a prompt. Once you have the prompt you can use the terminal as needed for other tasks. Always return to the root of project cd ~/vscode/student_2025 for all “make” actions. . Stop the preview server . Stopping the server ends the web server applications running process. However, it leaves constructed files in the project in a ready state for the next time you run make. . make stop . Clean the local web application environment . This command will top the server and “clean” all previously constructed files (ie .ipynb -&gt; .md). This is the best choice when renaming files has created duplicates that are visible when previewing work. . make clean . Observe build errors . Test Jupyter Notebook conversions (ie .ipynb -&gt; .md), this is the best choice to see if an IPYNB conversion error is occurring. . make convert . . Development Support . File Names in “_posts”, “_notebooks” . There are two primary directories for creating blogs. The “_posts” directory is for authoring in markdown only. The “_notebooks” allows for markdown, pythons, javascript and more. . To name a file, use the following structure (If dates are in the future, review your config.yml setting if you want them to be viewed). Review these naming conventions. . For markdown files in _posts: year-month-day-fileName.md GOOD EXAMPLE: 2021-08-02-First-Day.md | BAD EXAMPLE: 2021-8-2-first-day.md | BAD EXAMPLE: first-day.md | BAD EXAMPLE: 2069-12-31-First-Day.md | . | . | For Jupyter notebooks in _notebooks: year-month-day-fileName.ipynb GOOD EXAMPLE: 2021-08-02-First-Day.ipynb | BAD EXAMPLE: 2021-8-2-first-day.ipynb | BAD EXAMPLE: first-day.ipynb | BAD EXAMPLE: 2069-12-31-First-Day.ipynb | . | . | . Tags . Tags are used to organize pages by their tag the way to add tags is to add the following to your front matter such as the example seen here categories: [Tools] Each item in the same category will be lumped together to be seen easily on the search page. . Search . All pages can be searched for using the built-in search bar. This search bar will search for any word in the title of a page or in the page itself. This allows for easily finding pages and information that you are looking for. However, sometimes this may not be desirable so to hide a page from the search you need to add search_exclude: true to the front matter of the page. This will hide the page from appearing when the viewer uses search. . Navigation Bar . To add pages to the top navigation bar use _config.yml to order and determine which menus you want and how to order them. Review the_config.yml in this project for an example. . Blog Page . There is a blog page that has options for images and a description of the page. This page can help the viewer understand what the page is about and what they can expect to find on the page. The way to add images to a page is to have the following front matter image: /images/file.jpg and then the name of the image that you want to use. The image must be in the images folder. Furthermore, if you would like the file to not show up on the blog page hide: true can be added to the front matter. . SASS support . NIGHTHAWK Pages support a variety of different themes that are each overlaid on top of minima. To use each theme, go to the “_sass/minima/custom-styles.scss” file and simply comment or uncomment the theme you want to use. . To learn about the minima themes search for “GitHub Pages minima” and review the README. . To find a new theme search for “Github Pages Themes”. . Includes . Nighthawk Pages uses liquid syntax to import many common page elements that are present throughout the repository. These common elements are imported from the _includes directory. If you want to add one of these common elements, use liquid syntax to import the desired element to your file. Here’s an example of the liquid syntax used to import: `&lt;h3&gt; . &lt;/a&gt; . | . &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;post-meta&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; ` Note that the liquid syntax is surrounded by curly braces and percent signs. This can be used anywhere in the repository. . Layouts . To use or create a custom page layout, make an HTML page inside the _layouts directory, and when you want to use that layout in a file, use the following front matter layout: [your layout here]. All layouts will be written in liquid to define the structure of the page. | . Metadata . Metadata, also known as “front matter”, is a set of key-value pairs that can provide additional information to GitHub Pages about .md and .ipynb files. This can and probably will be used in other file types (ie doc, pdf) if we add them to the system. . In the front matter, you can also define things like a title and description for the page. Additional front matter is defined to place content on the “Computer Science Lab Notebook” page. The courses: key will place data on a specific page with the nested week: placing data on a specific row on the page. The type: key in “front matter” will place the blog under the plans, hacks(ToDo), and tangibles columns. . In our files, the front matter is defined at the top of the page or the first markdown cell. . First, open one of the .md or .ipynb files already included in either your _posts | _notebooks folder. | . | In the .md file, you should notice something similar to this at the top of the page. To see this in your .ipynb files you will need to double-click the markdown cell at the top of the file. | . toc: true comments: true layout: post title: Jupyter Python Sample description: Example Blog!!! This shows code and notes from hacks. type: ccc courses: { csa: {week: 5} } . | The front matter will always have ‘—’ at the top and bottom to distinguish it and each key-value pair will be separated by a ‘:’. . | Here we can modify things like the title and description. . | The type value will tell us which column this is going to appear under the time box supported pages. The “ccc” stands for Code, Code, Code. . | The courses will tell us which menu item it will be under, in this case, the csa menu, and the week tells it what row (week) it will appear under that menu. . | .",

How the language is selected ? . jupyter notebook command reads the LANG environment variable at startup, (xx_XX or just xx form, where xx is the language code you’re wanting to run in). | Hint: if running Windows, you can set it in PowerShell with ${Env:LANG} = &quot;xx_XX&quot;. if running Ubuntu 14, you should set environment variable LANGUAGE=&quot;xx_XX&quot;. . The preferred language for web pages in your browser settings (xx) is also used. At the moment, it has to be first in the list. | Contributing and managing translations . Requirements . pybabel (could be installed pip install babel) | po2json (could be installed with npm install -g po2json) | . All i18n-related commands are done from the related directory : . cd notebook/i18n/ . Message extraction . The translatable material for notebook is split into 3 .pot files, as follows: . notebook/i18n/notebook.pot - Console and startup messages, basically anything that is produced by Python code. | notebook/i18n/nbui.pot - User interface strings, as extracted from the Jinja2 templates in notebook/templates/*.html | noteook/i18n/nbjs.pot - JavaScript strings and dialogs, which contain much of the visible user interface for Jupyter notebook. | . To extract the messages from the source code whenever new material is added, use the pybabel command: . pybabel extract -F babel_notebook.cfg -o notebook.pot --no-wrap --project Jupyter . pybabel extract -F babel_nbui.cfg -o nbui.pot --no-wrap --project Jupyter . pybabel extract -F babel_nbjs.cfg -o nbjs.pot --no-wrap --project Jupyter . . After this is complete you have 3 .pot files that you can give to a translator for your favorite language. . Messages compilation . After the source material has been translated, you should have 3 .po files with the same base names as the .pot files above. Put them in notebook/i18n/${LANG}/LC_MESSAGES, where ${LANG} is the language code for your desired language ( i.e. German = “de”, Japanese = “ja”, etc. ). . notebook.po and nbui.po need to be converted from .po to .mo format for use at runtime. . pybabel compile -D notebook -f -l ${LANG} -i ${LANG}/LC_MESSAGES/notebook.po -o ${LANG}/LC_MESSAGES/notebook.mo pybabel compile -D nbui -f -l ${LANG} -i ${LANG}/LC_MESSAGES/nbui.po -o ${LANG}/LC_MESSAGES/nbui.mo . nbjs.po needs to be converted to JSON for use within the JavaScript code, with po2json, as follows: . po2json -p -F -f jed1.x -d nbjs ${LANG}/LC_MESSAGES/nbjs.po ${LANG}/LC_MESSAGES/nbjs.json . When new languages get added, their language codes should be added to notebook/i18n/nbjs.json under the supported_languages element. . Tips for Jupyter developers . The biggest “mistake” I found while doing i18n enablement was the habit of constructing UI messages from English “piece parts”. For example, code like: . var msg = &quot;Enter a new &quot; + type + &quot;name:&quot;; . where type is either “file”, “directory”, or “notebook”…. . is problematic when doing translations, because the surrounding text may need to vary depending on the inserted word. In this case, you need to switch it and use complete phrases, as follows: . var rename_msg = function (type) { switch (type) { case &quot;file&quot;: return _(&quot;Enter a new file name:&quot;); case &quot;directory&quot;: return _(&quot;Enter a new directory name:&quot;); case &quot;notebook&quot;: return _(&quot;Enter a new notebook name:&quot;); default: return _(&quot;Enter a new name:&quot;); } }; . Also you need to remember that adding an “s” or “es” to an English word to create the plural form doesn’t translate well. Some languages have as many as 5 or 6 different plural forms for differing numbers, so using an API such as ngettext() is necessary in order to handle these cases properly. . Known issues and future evolutions . Right now there are two different places where the desired language is set. At startup time, the Jupyter console’s messages pay attention to the setting of the ${LANG} environment variable as set in the shell at startup time. Unfortunately, this is also the time where the Jinja2 environment is set up, which means that the template stuff will always come from this setting. We really want to be paying attention to the browser’s settings for the stuff that happens in the browser, so we need to be able to retrieve this information after the browser is started and somehow communicate this back to Jinja2. So far, I haven’t yet figured out how to do this, which means that if the ${LANG} at startup doesn’t match the browser’s settings, you could potentially get a mix of languages in the UI ( never a good thing ). . | We will need to decide if console messages should be translatable, and enable them if desired. . | The keyboard shortcut editor was implemented after the i18n work was completed, so that portion does not have translation support at this time. . | Babel’s documentation has instructions on how to integrate messages extraction into your setup.py so that eventually we can just do: . ./setup.py extract_messages . | I hope to get this working at some point in the near future. 5. The conversions from .po to .mo probably can and should be done using setup.py install. . Any questions or comments please let me know @JCEmmons on github (emmo@us.ibm.com) .",

Some languages have as many as 5 or 6 different plural forms for differing numbers, so using an API such as ngettext() is necessary in order to handle these cases properly. . Known issues and future evolutions . Right now there are two different places where the desired language is set. At startup time, the Jupyter console’s messages pay attention to the setting of the ${LANG} environment variable as set in the shell at startup time. Unfortunately, this is also the time where the Jinja2 environment is set up, which means that the template stuff will always come from this setting. We really want to be paying attention to the browser’s settings for the stuff that happens in the browser, so we need to be able to retrieve this information after the browser is started and somehow communicate this back to Jinja2. So far, I haven’t yet figured out how to do this, which means that if the ${LANG} at startup doesn’t match the browser’s settings, you could potentially get a mix of languages in the UI ( never a good thing ). . | We will need to decide if console messages should be translatable, and enable them if desired. . | The keyboard shortcut editor was implemented after the i18n work was completed, so that portion does not have translation support at this time. . | Babel’s documentation has instructions on how to integrate messages extraction into your setup.py so that eventually we can just do: . ./setup.py extract_messages . | I hope to get this working at some point in the near future. 5. The conversions from .po to .mo probably can and should be done using setup.py install. . Any questions or comments please let me know @JCEmmons on github (emmo@us.ibm.com) .",
